        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          I am a dedicated educator with a deep interest in technology and innovation. Currently teaching Computer Applications and IT to undergraduate students at Jammu University, I have been shaping young minds with practical knowledge and hands-on skills. After completing my MCA from Jammu University in 2021, I took on the role of a guest lecturer at GDC Pouni, where I continue to share my passion for computing.
          <br /><br />
          I believe in continuous learning and keep myself updated with emerging trends in information technology. My teaching approach focuses on blending theory with practical implementation, enabling students to better understand concepts and apply them in real-world scenarios.
          <br /><br />
          Outside the classroom, I engage in tech-driven projects and content creation. I design digital content, edit educational and promotional videos, and manage a YouTube channel that shares insights on technology, IoT, and academic topics. I'm passionate about inspiring students and viewers to explore new technological frontiers.
          <br /><br />
          My creative side finds expression in visual design, combining aesthetics with purpose. As a multi-disciplinary creator, I aim to merge my skills in education, engineering, and media to make technology more accessible and impactful.
